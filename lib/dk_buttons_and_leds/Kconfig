	  With this option disabled, the module periodically scans all the
	  available buttons until no button is pressed. If no button is
	  pressed, the module uses GPIO interrupts to detect the first button
	  press. On the first button press, the module switches back to
	  periodically scanning buttons.

	  Enable this option to avoid relying on GPIO interrupts at all and
	  to unconditionally scan all buttons periodically. Please note that
	  the constant scanning activity increases the overall power
	  consumption of the system.

	  For example, the option must be set for the nRF54L15 PDK revision
	  AA0 ES2 in case the application uses Button 3 or 4. This version
	  of the PDK has Button 3 and 4 connected to the GPIO port 2 which
	  does not support interrupts.
